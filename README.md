- Project description:-
1) MASTER control clock system.
2) MASTER measuring tempreatcure then send it to SLAVE1 to control air conditionar and heater system.
3) MASTER measuring light intensity then send it to SLAVE2 to control illumination system.
1) SLAVE2 control door system.

door system:
user creat password using keypad and save it in the EEPROM, then use it to open the gate, user can recreat the password again.

illumination system:
1) stairs light: using push button to turn on led for ten seconde, counting the seconde using timer0 and despalying it using BCD seven segment.
2) outdoor light: MASTER read LDR using ADC then send it to SLAVE2 using USART, then SLAVE2 turn on the lamp connected to relay if the reading is higher than 50, and turn off the lamp if the reading is lower than 50.

air conditionar and heater system:
MASTER read the temperature using TC74, then sends it to SLAVE1 using I2C, SLAVE1 controls the operation as following:-
1) if the temperature is between 25 and 30 degrees, no operation happens.
2) if the temperature is higher than 30 degrees, the air conditioner turns on and spead It increases gradually in proportion to temperature.
3) if the temperature is lower than 20 degrees, the heater turns on with constant speed.
speed is generated by PWM from CCP module.

clock system:
MASTER reading the date and time from RTC(DC1307) using I2C, then displaying it on the LCD, setting the alarm, and adjusting the date and time using the buttons, then updating the date and time in RTC(DC1307) using I2C, when alarm time comes buzzer turns on.
